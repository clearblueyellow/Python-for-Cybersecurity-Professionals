# Python for Cybersecurity Professionals

In the contemporary cybersecurity landscape, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are confronted with an ever-increasing volume and sophistication of threats. To effectively manage this deluge of data, detect malicious activities, and respond swiftly to incidents, automation has become indispensable. Python, with its straightforward syntax, extensive libraries, and versatile capabilities, has emerged as a pivotal programming language for cybersecurity professionals, particularly within SOC environments. Its accessibility allows analysts who may not be dedicated software developers to create powerful tools, while its comprehensive standard library and rich ecosystem of third-party packages provide the means to tackle complex security challenges.

## SimpleExtractor - IOC Extractor from Unstructured Text

SOC analysts frequently encounter IOCs—such as IP addresses, domain names, file hashes, and URLs—embedded within unstructured text sources. These sources can include threat intelligence reports, security blogs, forum discussions, social media posts, or even internal incident notes. Manually sifting through large volumes of text to identify and extract these IOCs is a time-consuming, error-prone, and often tedious task. An automated IOC extractor script significantly streamlines this process, enabling analysts to quickly gather potential threat indicators for further investigation, enrichment, or input into security tools like SIEMs or TIPs. This automation frees up valuable analyst time, allowing them to focus on higher-value analytical tasks rather than manual data extraction. The ability to rapidly process diverse textual data for IOCs is crucial for maintaining situational awareness and responding effectively to emerging threats.

## Splunk Custom Alert Actions/Enrichment Script

Splunk is a cornerstone of many SOCs for log aggregation, searching, and alerting. While Splunk's built-in alerting capabilities are robust, Python scripts can extend them significantly by enabling custom alert actions and automated enrichment of alert data. Instead of an alert merely triggering an email or a ticket, a custom Python script can execute a complex workflow. This could involve querying external threat intelligence feeds for IOCs found in the alert, checking internal asset databases for system ownership, looking up WHOIS information for suspicious domains, or even initiating automated responses like adding an IP to a firewall blocklist via an API. The splunk-alert-script found in the Splunk-Automation-Tools repository, which polls the Splunk API to generate alerts from search results, exemplifies a form of custom alerting logic. Such scripts transform raw alerts into more context-rich and actionable intelligence.

## Automated IOC Reputation Checker (via VirusTotal API)

 fundamental task in SOC operations is assessing the risk associated with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domain names, URLs, or file hashes. Manually checking each IOC against various threat intelligence sources is inefficient, especially when dealing with multiple indicators from an alert or investigation. An automated IOC reputation checker script, typically leveraging APIs from services like VirusTotal, streamlines this process significantly. It provides analysts with quick, consolidated insights into whether an IOC is known malicious, suspicious, or benign, which is crucial for prioritizing alerts, guiding incident response efforts, and making informed decisions about potential threats. This script can be used ad-hoc by analysts or integrated into other automated workflows, such as the Splunk custom alert action script (Script 3) or after IOC extraction (Script 1).

 ## Suspicious Email Analyzer (EML Parser)

 Email remains a primary vector for cyberattacks, including phishing, malware distribution, and business email compromise. SOCs often receive suspicious emails reported by users (e.g., via a phish-button) or quarantined by email security gateways, typically in the .eml (email message) format. Manually analyzing each .eml file to extract headers, body content, links, and attachments is highly time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge. A Python script designed to parse .eml files automates this initial triage, extracting key indicators and metadata. This allows analysts to quickly assess the potential threat posed by an email, identify actionable IOCs, and decide whether further in-depth investigation, escalation, or blocking actions are warranted. Scripts like meioc (Mail Extractor IoC) are specifically built for this purpose, providing a structured output of extracted information.

## Locate Executable Files with Python

This project entails the construction of a Python script to effectively locate .exe files across a computer's filesystem. The solution leverages the standard os and os.path modules, employing os.walk for efficient recursive directory traversal and os.path.splitext for accurate file extension identification. Key considerations for robustness include platform-independent path construction using os.path.join and comprehensive error handling using both try...except blocks within the processing loop and the onerror callback for os.walk to manage permissions issues gracefully.

The definition of the search scope (the root directories) is critical. While specific paths can be provided manually, the third-party psutil library offers a cross-platform method for programmatically discovering potential starting points (drives/mount points), although careful filtering is often required for practical application. The final script presented integrates these components, providing a functional and adaptable tool for filesystem searching. The alternatives using pathlib or glob offer different syntaxes but generally less control over the traversal and error handling compared to the os.walk-based approach detailed herein.
